Title: Analysis of pulsed-SILAC quantitative proteomics data
Version: 0.99.0
Author: Marc Pagès-Gallego
Maintainer: Marc Pagès-Gallego <M.PagesGallego@umcutrecht.nl>
Description: This package provides with several tools for pulsed-SILAC data
    analysis. It requires input of isotope intensities or ratios as generated by 
    quantitative analysis software such as MaxQuant. Functions are provided to 
    organize the data, filter, estimate cell growth, normalize, estimate model
    turnover, model comparison and estimate light isotope recycling. There are 
    also some exploratory data analysis visualization functions.
